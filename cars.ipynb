THE DASHBOARD WENT \"DARK OR BLANK\" BUT CAME RIGHT BACK ON, AND MY WIPERS TURNED ON BY ITSELF. I DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF THE WIPERS WHILE THEY ARE \"ON\" AND IT WILL TURN ITSELF OFF AS SOON AS THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS ARE BACK. THE SMOKE AND BURNING SMELL DIDN'T LAST LONG. IT HAPPENED FAST WITHOUT WARNING AND GONE QUICKLY. IT STOPPED BY THE TIME I FOUND A SAFE PARKING SPOT. WHILE PARKED, I FOUND OUT THAT I LOST MY LIGHTS (HEADLIGHTS, TAIL LIGHTS AND SIGNAL LIGHTS) BUT THE HORN, POWER WINDOWS/DOORS/LOCKS AND RADIO ARE STILL WORKING. MY DASHBOARD INDICATOR SHOWED SOMETHING ABOUT \"FUSE\" WARNING. I CALLED THE DODGE DEALER (WHO JUST PERFORMED THE OIL CHANGE) AND TOLD A SERVICE ADVISOR WHAT JUST HAPPENED.  I TOLD THE ADVISOR THAT THE \"ENGINE LIGHT\" CAME ON BUT IT IS STEADY AND NOT FLASHING. BACK AT THE DEALERSHIP, I TOLD THE SERVICE ADVISOR THAT MY DASHBOARD WENT \"DARK\" &amp; WIPERS COMBO AGAIN AT LEAST 3X ON THE WAY BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE SERVICE ADVISOR CHECKED THE JOURNEY AND CAME BACK WITH THE BAD NEWS OF MELTED DASHBOARD HARNESS / INSTRUMENT CLUSTER DAMAGED DUE TO AN \"ELECTRICAL SHORT\" AND COST OF ABOUT $5K REPAIR. THE DEALER DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED THE \"ELECTRICAL SHORT\".   FILED AUTO INSURANCE CLAIM AND THEY ARE NOT COVERING IT (NOT COMPREHENSIVE) BECAUSE THERE'S NO FIRE (CONTAINED)  AND THEY ARE CALLING IT A MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN!</td>\n",

UNFORTUNATELY, THIS HAS RESULTED IN AN UNWANTED CONSEQUENCE OF RODENTS BEING ATTRACTED TO MY CAR. THEY ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO CHEW THROUGH THE WIRES AND THIS CAN RESULT IN A VERY EXPENSIVE REPAIR BILL FROM HONDA. THIS IS SOMETHING THEY DID TO THE VEHICLES THEY MANUFACTURER, AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE MAKING US VEHICLE OWNERS PAY FOR THE REPAIR BILLS IS UNACCEPTABLE TO ME, BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO? I'VE READ ONLINE THIS IS NOT JUST AFFECTING VEHICLE OWNERS IN RURAL AREAS, BUT OWNERS WHO LIVE IN CITIES LIKE I DO. SO FAR, I'VE HAD TO USE SOME BITTER APPLE SPRAY THAT ONLY CAUSES THE RODENTS TO TRY NIBBLING ELSEWHERE IN THE ENGINE BAY.  I DON'T HAVE ANY PICTURES, BUT I CAN TAKE SOME UPON REQUEST. I'D HATE TO BE DRIVING WHEN SOMETHING FAILS.  \n",

I TRIED TO START THE CAR BUT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN. I WAS IN THE CAR LEFT LANE WHEN THE CAR BEGIN TO DECREASE IN SPEED AND AS I TRIED TO PULL OVER THERE WERE CARS PASSING AND I WAS ALMOST HIT NOT ONLY FROM BEHIND BUT ON THE SIDE BECAUSE THE CAR COULD NOT BE DRIVEN FAST ENOUGH TO PULL OFF THE ROAD.  \n",

WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, I DEPRESSED THE GAS PEDAL, BUT THE VEHICLE FAILED TO MOVE. INSTEAD, IT HESITATED, BUCKED A BIT, AND THEN LOST POWER ALTOGETHER. I PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND, AFTER A COUPLE OF TRIES, THE CAR RESTARTED. AS I ACCELERATED, THE CAR EXHIBITED MORE HESITATION, THEN OPERATED NORMALLY. IRONICALLY, I WAS ON THE WAY TO THE LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALER TO PICK UP OUR OTHER VEHICLE AND MADE IT THERE. I REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO THE DEALER AND TURNED IT OVER TO THEM FOR DIAGNOSIS/REPAIR. THE DEALER COULD NEITHER DETECT ANY PROBLEM NOR DUPLICATE THE INCIDENT.  ACCORDING TO THEIR WRITE-UP: \"SCANNED FOR CODES. NO DTCS AT THIS TIME. FUEL PRESSURE IS NORMAL. 10 MILE TEST DRIVE AND UPDATE HAS ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED....UNABLE TO DUPLICATE...\"  THIS MORNING, I LEARNED THAT HYUNDAI HAS RECALLED 1.2 MILLION VEHICLES AND SYMPTOMS OF THE PROBLEM ARE EXACTLY THOSE THAT MY VEHICLE EXHIBITED. HOWEVER, MY VEHICLE IS A 2015 MODEL AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE COVERED BY THE RECALL, NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROBLEM I EXPERIENCED YESTERDAY.  IN ANY CASE, MY VEHICLE HAS ONLY 26K MILES AND HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED BY THE DEALER.  I SUSPECT IT HAS THE PROBLEM FOR WHICH HYUNDAI IS NOW RECALLING OVER A MILLION VEHICLES.  \n",

CAR IS USUALLY DRIVEN BY 5' 3\" DRIVER WITHOUT THIS PROBLEM; BUT I AM 6\" 3\" AND MY KNEE CONTINUALLY HITS THE IGNITION KEY FOB AS I MOVE MY FOOT FROM THE ACCELERATOR TO THE BRAKE.

       "1075437  ON APRIL 1ST 2017 WHILE DRIVING HOME AFTER AN OIL CHANGE AND TIRE ROTATION JOB BY A DODGE DEALERSHIP, I NOTICED SMOKE COMING UNDER THE DRIVER'S DASHBOARD SIDE AND BURNING SMELL, AFTER EXITING THE FREEWAY. THE DASHBOARD WENT \"DARK OR BLANK\" BUT CAME RIGHT BACK ON, AND MY WIPERS TURNED ON BY ITSELF. I DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF THE WIPERS WHILE THEY ARE \"ON\" AND IT WILL TURN ITSELF OFF AS SOON AS THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS ARE BACK. THE SMOKE AND BURNING SMELL DIDN'T LAST LONG. IT HAPPENED FAST WITHOUT WARNING AND GONE QUICKLY. IT STOPPED BY THE TIME I FOUND A SAFE PARKING SPOT. WHILE PARKED, I FOUND OUT THAT I LOST MY LIGHTS (HEADLIGHTS, TAIL LIGHTS AND SIGNAL LIGHTS) BUT THE HORN, POWER WINDOWS/DOORS/LOCKS AND RADIO ARE STILL WORKING. MY DASHBOARD INDICATOR SHOWED SOMETHING ABOUT \"FUSE\" WARNING. I CALLED THE DODGE DEALER (WHO JUST PERFORMED THE OIL CHANGE) AND TOLD A SERVICE ADVISOR WHAT JUST HAPPENED.  I TOLD THE ADVISOR THAT THE \"ENGINE LIGHT\" CAME ON BUT IT IS STEADY AND NOT FLASHING. BACK AT THE DEALERSHIP, I TOLD THE SERVICE ADVISOR THAT MY DASHBOARD WENT \"DARK\" & WIPERS COMBO AGAIN AT LEAST 3X ON THE WAY BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE SERVICE ADVISOR CHECKED THE JOURNEY AND CAME BACK WITH THE BAD NEWS OF MELTED DASHBOARD HARNESS / INSTRUMENT CLUSTER DAMAGED DUE TO AN \"ELECTRICAL SHORT\" AND COST OF ABOUT $5K REPAIR.

THE FIRST TIME I TOOK THE CAR TO THE MECHANIC THEY TOLD ME IT WAS THE MASTER CYLINDER AND THAT IT WAS REPLACE THIS WAS LAST YEAR. YESTERDAY I WAS DRIVING AND THE SAME THING OCCURRED I CHANGED MY BRAKES AND THEN WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS NOT MY BRAKES. I AM LEAKING BRAKE FLUID AND THAT IT IS MY MASTER CYLINDER.

REFLECTOR IS MADE OUT OF PLASTIC AND NORMAL HEAT FROM BULB MELTS THE PLASTIC.  THIS MAKES IT VERY UNSAFE AND DIFFICULT TO SEE AT NIGHT.  THIS SEEMS TO BE EXTREMELY COMMON ON THE INTERNET. THE SOLUTION IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND DUE TO THIS COST,MOST PEOPLE WILL NOT FIX AND DRIVE UNDER THIS UNSAFE SITUATION.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AND HOLD BMW RESPONSIBLE.  \n",

OCCASIONALLY BOTH LOW BEAMS, MOST OF THE TIME IT IS A SINGLE SIDE. AFTER MULTIPLE TIMES STARTING AND RESTARTING THE VEHICLE IT WILL RELIGHT....IT CAN SIT FOR HOURS AND RELIGHT, OR WON'T RELIGHT THAT DAY...IT CAN STILL CHANGE BETWEEN PASSENGER AND DRIVER SIDE AND BACK.    BULBS CHECK OUT OK, BOTH HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLIES REPLACED, STILL NO CHANGE- IT CAN GO OUT AT ANY TIME. DOES NOT SEEM TO BE RELATED TO TEMPERATURE OR HUMIDITY.  EXCEPTIONALLY DANGEROUS IF I'M SOMEWHERE AT NIGHT AWAY FROM HOME AND THE HEADLIGHTS WON'T COME ON; THIS ACTUALLY HAPPEND ON A CROSS COUNTRY TRIP  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT OF ARIZONA. I FOUND MULTIPLE PAGES OF SIMILAR PEOPLE ONLINE WHO ARE HAVING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM...THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ASAP, VW HAS A HOST OF PROBLEMS THEY REFUSE TO ADDRESS AS WARRANTY EVEN WHEN IT IS PAINFULLY OBVIOUS IT IS WHAT THEY ARE BOUND TO BY THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS- THEIR RESPONSIBILITY - REGARDLESS ON WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO COVER HIS IS A SERIOUS SAFET ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESS BEFORE SOMEBODY IS KILLED TRYING TO DRIVE HOME FROM A PLACE THEY'RE STRANDED WITHOUT HEADLIGHTS.  \n",

       "      <td>ON APRIL 1ST 2017 WHILE DRIVING HOME AFTER AN OIL CHANGE AND TIRE ROTATION JOB BY A DODGE DEALERSHIP, I NOTICED SMOKE COMING UNDER THE DRIVER'S DASHBOARD SIDE AND BURNING SMELL, AFTER EXITING THE FREEWAY. THE DASHBOARD WENT \"DARK OR BLANK\" BUT CAME RIGHT BACK ON, AND MY WIPERS TURNED ON BY ITSELF. I DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF THE WIPERS WHILE THEY ARE \"ON\" AND IT WILL TURN ITSELF OFF AS SOON AS THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS ARE BACK. THE SMOKE AND BURNING SMELL DIDN'T LAST LONG. IT HAPPENED FAST WITHOUT WARNING AND GONE QUICKLY. IT STOPPED BY THE TIME I FOUND A SAFE PARKING SPOT. WHILE PARKED, I FOUND OUT THAT I LOST MY LIGHTS (HEADLIGHTS, TAIL LIGHTS AND SIGNAL LIGHTS) BUT THE HORN, POWER WINDOWS/DOORS/LOCKS AND RADIO ARE STILL WORKING. MY DASHBOARD INDICATOR SHOWED SOMETHING ABOUT \"FUSE\" WARNING. I CALLED THE DODGE DEALER (WHO JUST PERFORMED THE OIL CHANGE) AND TOLD A SERVICE ADVISOR WHAT JUST HAPPENED.  I TOLD THE ADVISOR THAT THE \"ENGINE LIGHT\" CAME ON BUT IT IS STEADY AND NOT FLASHING. BACK AT THE DEALERSHIP, I TOLD THE SERVICE ADVISOR THAT MY DASHBOARD WENT \"DARK\" &amp; WIPERS COMBO AGAIN AT LEAST 3X ON THE WAY BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE SERVICE ADVISOR CHECKED THE JOURNEY AND CAME BACK WITH THE BAD NEWS OF MELTED DASHBOARD HARNESS / INSTRUMENT CLUSTER DAMAGED DUE TO AN \"ELECTRICAL SHORT\" AND COST OF ABOUT $5K REPAIR. THE DEALER DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED THE \"ELECTRICAL SHORT\".   FILED AUTO INSURANCE CLAIM AND THEY ARE NOT COVERING IT (NOT COMPREHENSIVE) BECAUSE THERE'S NO FIRE (CONTAINED)  AND THEY ARE CALLING IT A MECHANICAL BREAKDOWN!</td>\n",

UNFORTUNATELY, THIS HAS RESULTED IN AN UNWANTED CONSEQUENCE OF RODENTS BEING ATTRACTED TO MY CAR. THEY ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO CHEW THROUGH THE WIRES AND THIS CAN RESULT IN A VERY EXPENSIVE REPAIR BILL FROM HONDA. THIS IS SOMETHING THEY DID TO THE VEHICLES THEY MANUFACTURER, AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE MAKING US VEHICLE OWNERS PAY FOR THE REPAIR BILLS IS UNACCEPTABLE TO ME, BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO? I'VE READ ONLINE THIS IS NOT JUST AFFECTING VEHICLE OWNERS IN RURAL AREAS, BUT OWNERS WHO LIVE IN CITIES LIKE I DO. SO FAR, I'VE HAD TO USE SOME BITTER APPLE SPRAY THAT ONLY CAUSES THE RODENTS TO TRY NIBBLING ELSEWHERE IN THE ENGINE BAY.  I DON'T HAVE ANY PICTURES, BUT I CAN TAKE SOME UPON REQUEST. I'D HATE TO BE DRIVING WHEN SOMETHING FAILS.  \n",

I TRIED TO START THE CAR BUT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN. I WAS IN THE CAR LEFT LANE WHEN THE CAR BEGIN TO DECREASE IN SPEED AND AS I TRIED TO PULL OVER THERE WERE CARS PASSING AND I WAS ALMOST HIT NOT ONLY FROM BEHIND BUT ON THE SIDE BECAUSE THE CAR COULD NOT BE DRIVEN FAST ENOUGH TO PULL OFF THE ROAD.  \n",

WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, I DEPRESSED THE GAS PEDAL, BUT THE VEHICLE FAILED TO MOVE. INSTEAD, IT HESITATED, BUCKED A BIT, AND THEN LOST POWER ALTOGETHER. I PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND, AFTER A COUPLE OF TRIES, THE CAR RESTARTED. AS I ACCELERATED, THE CAR EXHIBITED MORE HESITATION, THEN OPERATED NORMALLY. IRONICALLY, I WAS ON THE WAY TO THE LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALER TO PICK UP OUR OTHER VEHICLE AND MADE IT THERE. I REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO THE DEALER AND TURNED IT OVER TO THEM FOR DIAGNOSIS/REPAIR. THE DEALER COULD NEITHER DETECT ANY PROBLEM NOR DUPLICATE THE INCIDENT.  ACCORDING TO THEIR WRITE-UP: \"SCANNED FOR CODES. NO DTCS AT THIS TIME. FUEL PRESSURE IS NORMAL. 10 MILE TEST DRIVE AND UPDATE HAS ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED....UNABLE TO DUPLICATE...\"  THIS MORNING, I LEARNED THAT HYUNDAI HAS RECALLED 1.2 MILLION VEHICLES AND SYMPTOMS OF THE PROBLEM ARE EXACTLY THOSE THAT MY VEHICLE EXHIBITED. HOWEVER, MY VEHICLE IS A 2015 MODEL AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE COVERED BY THE RECALL, NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROBLEM I EXPERIENCED YESTERDAY.  IN ANY CASE, MY VEHICLE HAS ONLY 26K MILES AND HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED BY THE DEALER.  I SUSPECT IT HAS THE PROBLEM FOR WHICH HYUNDAI IS NOW RECALLING OVER A MILLION VEHICLES.  \n",

CAR IS USUALLY DRIVEN BY 5' 3\" DRIVER WITHOUT THIS PROBLEM; BUT I AM 6\" 3\" AND MY KNEE CONTINUALLY HITS THE IGNITION KEY FOB AS I MOVE MY FOOT FROM THE ACCELERATOR TO THE BRAKE.

       "1075437  ON APRIL 1ST 2017 WHILE DRIVING HOME AFTER AN OIL CHANGE AND TIRE ROTATION JOB BY A DODGE DEALERSHIP, I NOTICED SMOKE COMING UNDER THE DRIVER'S DASHBOARD SIDE AND BURNING SMELL, AFTER EXITING THE FREEWAY. THE DASHBOARD WENT \"DARK OR BLANK\" BUT CAME RIGHT BACK ON, AND MY WIPERS TURNED ON BY ITSELF. I DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF THE WIPERS WHILE THEY ARE \"ON\" AND IT WILL TURN ITSELF OFF AS SOON AS THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS ARE BACK. THE SMOKE AND BURNING SMELL DIDN'T LAST LONG. IT HAPPENED FAST WITHOUT WARNING AND GONE QUICKLY. IT STOPPED BY THE TIME I FOUND A SAFE PARKING SPOT. WHILE PARKED, I FOUND OUT THAT I LOST MY LIGHTS (HEADLIGHTS, TAIL LIGHTS AND SIGNAL LIGHTS) BUT THE HORN, POWER WINDOWS/DOORS/LOCKS AND RADIO ARE STILL WORKING. MY DASHBOARD INDICATOR SHOWED SOMETHING ABOUT \"FUSE\" WARNING. I CALLED THE DODGE DEALER (WHO JUST PERFORMED THE OIL CHANGE) AND TOLD A SERVICE ADVISOR WHAT JUST HAPPENED.  I TOLD THE ADVISOR THAT THE \"ENGINE LIGHT\" CAME ON BUT IT IS STEADY AND NOT FLASHING. BACK AT THE DEALERSHIP, I TOLD THE SERVICE ADVISOR THAT MY DASHBOARD WENT \"DARK\" & WIPERS COMBO AGAIN AT LEAST 3X ON THE WAY BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE SERVICE ADVISOR CHECKED THE JOURNEY AND CAME BACK WITH THE BAD NEWS OF MELTED DASHBOARD HARNESS / INSTRUMENT CLUSTER DAMAGED DUE TO AN \"ELECTRICAL SHORT\" AND COST OF ABOUT $5K REPAIR.

THE FIRST TIME I TOOK THE CAR TO THE MECHANIC THEY TOLD ME IT WAS THE MASTER CYLINDER AND THAT IT WAS REPLACE THIS WAS LAST YEAR. YESTERDAY I WAS DRIVING AND THE SAME THING OCCURRED I CHANGED MY BRAKES AND THEN WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS NOT MY BRAKES. I AM LEAKING BRAKE FLUID AND THAT IT IS MY MASTER CYLINDER.

OCCASIONALLY BOTH LOW BEAMS, MOST OF THE TIME IT IS A SINGLE SIDE. AFTER MULTIPLE TIMES STARTING AND RESTARTING THE VEHICLE IT WILL RELIGHT....IT CAN SIT FOR HOURS AND RELIGHT, OR WON'T RELIGHT THAT DAY...IT CAN STILL CHANGE BETWEEN PASSENGER AND DRIVER SIDE AND BACK.    BULBS CHECK OUT OK, BOTH HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLIES REPLACED, STILL NO CHANGE- IT CAN GO OUT AT ANY TIME. DOES NOT SEEM TO BE RELATED TO TEMPERATURE OR HUMIDITY.  EXCEPTIONALLY DANGEROUS IF I'M SOMEWHERE AT NIGHT AWAY FROM HOME AND THE HEADLIGHTS WON'T COME ON; THIS ACTUALLY HAPPEND ON A CROSS COUNTRY TRIP  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT OF ARIZONA. I FOUND MULTIPLE PAGES OF SIMILAR PEOPLE ONLINE WHO ARE HAVING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM...THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ASAP, VW HAS A HOST OF PROBLEMS THEY REFUSE TO ADDRESS AS WARRANTY EVEN WHEN IT IS PAINFULLY OBVIOUS IT IS WHAT THEY ARE BOUND TO BY THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS- THEIR RESPONSIBILITY - REGARDLESS ON WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO COVER HIS IS A SERIOUS SAFET ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESS BEFORE SOMEBODY IS KILLED TRYING TO DRIVE HOME FROM A PLACE THEY'RE STRANDED WITHOUT HEADLIGHTS.  \n",
